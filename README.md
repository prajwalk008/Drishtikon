# 🦯 Drishtikon – ML-Powered Navigation for the Visually Impaired

> **"Bringing light to the unseen."**

Drishtikon is a wearable AI-based navigation system designed to empower visually impaired individuals with real-time obstacle detection, path planning, and threat recognition—allowing them to navigate confidently, independently, and safely through any environment.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Drishtikon** is an assistive tech solution that leverages AI, computer vision, and real-time feedback to bridge the gap between visual impairment and independent mobility. It was developed as part of **Init to Winit - Hack for Impact** at **E-Summit 2025, IIIT Delhi**.

### 👁️ Problem

Over **285 million people** globally are visually impaired, with **90%** living in developing countries. Traditional white canes offer limited situational awareness, making it difficult to navigate complex environments safely and independently.
